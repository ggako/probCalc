## About the Project
### This project aims to build an application that can estimate the placement probabilities (chances of winning and reaching qualification placements) of every team participating in a single tournament given current standings and remaining rounds. 

### The value of the resulting estimation can be useful in setting expectations, and for teams, could potentially provide pressure or relief and help them make informative decisions of how they could approach the tournament.

#### Trivia: Why a mountain logo? It depicts the movement of team standings throughout the tournament (some teams ascend to the top / fall to the bottom of the leaderboard)
