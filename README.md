### An application that can estimate the placement probabilities (chances of winning and reaching qualification placements) of every team in a single tournament given current standings and remaining rounds. 

### The value of the resulting approximation can be useful in setting expectations and for teams, could potentially help them make informative decisions of how they could approach the tournament with the information from the calculations.

##### Why a mountain logo? It depicts the movement of team standings throughout the tournament (some teams ascend to the top / fall to the bottom of the leaderboard)
